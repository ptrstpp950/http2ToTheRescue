    <p>Each HTTP transfer carries a set of headers that describe the transferred resource and its properties. In HTTP/1.x, this
        metadata is always sent as plain text and adds anywhere from 500â€“800 bytes of overhead per transfer, and sometimes
        kilobytes more if HTTP cookies are being used; see
        <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/http1x/#measuring-and-controlling-protocol-overhead">Measuring and
        Controlling Protocol Overhead</a>. To reduce this overhead and improve performance, HTTP/2 compresses request and
        response header metadata using the HPACK compression format that uses two simple but powerful techniques:

    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>It allows the transmitted header fields to be encoded via a static Huffman code, which reduces their individual
                transfer size.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It requires that both the client and server maintain and update an indexed list of previously seen header fields
                (i.e., establishes a shared compression context), which is then used as a reference to efficiently encode
                previously transmitted values.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Huffman coding allows the individual values to be compressed when transferred, and the indexed list of previously transferred
        values allows us to encode duplicate values (<a data-type="xref" href="#hpack">Figure&nbsp;12-6</a>) by transferring
        index values that can be used to efficiently look up and reconstruct the full header keys and values.

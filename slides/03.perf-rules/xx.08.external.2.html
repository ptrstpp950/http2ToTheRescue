<h2>Server push</h2>
<p>Intead of inlining use server push:
	<ul>
		<li>Delivers granular resources, which can be cached individually</li>
		<li>Delivers granular resources, which can be mux’ed and prioritized correctly</li>
		<li>Allows the client to opt-in / opt-out and control how and where it is used:
			<ul>
				<li>Server push is subject to flow control - e.g. "you can only push 5KB"</li>
				<li>Server push is optional and can be disabled by the client</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

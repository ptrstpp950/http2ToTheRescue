<h2>GZIP in headers?</h2>
<p>
    Early versions of HTTP/2 and SPDY used zlib, with a custom dictionary, to compress all HTTP headers, which delivered 85%–88%
    reduction.

<blockquote>
    On the lower-bandwidth DSL link, in which the upload link is only 375 Kbps, request header compression in particular, led
    to significant page load time improvements for certain sites (i.e., those that issued large number of resource requests).
    We found a reduction of <strong>45–1142 ms</strong> in page load time simply due to header compression.<br/>(SPDY whitepaper, chromium.org)
